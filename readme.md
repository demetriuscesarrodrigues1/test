README

This README provides an overview of the DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) script, its functionalities, and the workflow it orchestrates, along with the Snowflake setup and integration with Power BI.

DAG Script Overview
The DAG script is designed to process two JSON files, Students.json and missed_days.json, perform data validation, cleaning, and merging, and finally store the result in a CSV file named final_merged.csv. The workflow includes the following steps:

Data Ingestion: The script reads the Students.json and missed_days.json files to load the student information and missed days data, respectively.

Data Validation: Before proceeding with data processing, the script performs validation checks on the input data. This includes ensuring the presence of essential fields, data types, and integrity constraints.

Data Cleaning: Any inconsistencies or discrepancies in the data are addressed during the cleaning phase. This involves handling missing values, outliers, or invalid entries to ensure data quality.

Data Transformation: The script conducts a join operation on the two datasets based on the common student_id field to merge the information into a single cohesive dataset.

Output Creation: After merging the data, the script generates the final_merged.csv file containing the combined student information along with the corresponding missed days.

Snowflake Setup
The script assumes the presence of a Snowflake database named Views_students, along with the creation of schemas (Students_semantic and Students_staging) within this database. The workflow includes the following Snowflake setup steps:

Database Creation: If not already existing, the script creates the Views_students database.

Schema Creation: Two schemas, Students_semantic and Students_staging, are established within the Views_students database to organize the tables and views.

Table Creation: The script creates the final_merged table within the Students_staging schema to store the merged data.

View Creation: A view named w_students is generated in the Students_semantic schema, which presents a filtered subset of data based on specific criteria.

Power BI Integration
Once the final_merged.csv file is created and stored, it can be imported into Power BI for further analysis and visualization. A dashboard is created within Power BI, incorporating data from the w_students view in Snowflake to provide insights into student performance and attendance.

Conclusion
This DAG script automates the process of merging student data and missed days information, ensuring data integrity, and facilitating downstream analysis. The integration with Snowflake and Power BI enables efficient data storage, retrieval, and visualization, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the insights derived from the combined dataset.
